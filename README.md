Introduction
Hand gesture recognition has numerous applications, including sign language interpretation, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality control. This project focuses on building a CNN model to accurately classify hand gestures from input images.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
scikit-image
Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. It also includes fully connected layers for classification. The model architecture is detailed in the code.

Training
The model is trained on a dataset of hand gesture images. Data augmentation techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization.

Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on a separate validation dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's performance.

Prediction
Given an input image, the trained model predicts the corresponding hand gesture class. The predicted class label is displayed along with the input image.

Results
The project achieves high accuracy in hand gesture recognition, as demonstrated by the evaluation metrics and prediction results.
